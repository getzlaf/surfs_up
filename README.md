## Overview

## Summary
With those kind of results, an ice cream shop can be profitable. People usually enjoy eating ice cream between 70 and 75 degrees. However, W.Avy might want some more details about the weather. For example, he should ask about the rain or even the wind. If it's usually raining or windy, an ice cream shop will not be profitable. People won't go to the beach and spend on ice cream or surf equipment. W.Avy could also be interested in the weather frequency during the months of june and december. Luckily, we have done it for him (See the image below). 


W.Avy can observe that the vast majority of june days are between 70 and 79 degrees. In december, it's more between 67 and 76 degrees.
