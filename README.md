## Overview

## Results

1- On average, it's hotter in june than it is in december (74.94 degrees vs 71.04 degrees)

2- There is more weather variation in december than in june (std= 3.76 vs std= 3.26)

3- The lowest temperature you can expect in December is 56 degrees, compared to a 64 degrees in June.

## Summary
With those kind of results, an ice cream shop can be profitable. People usually enjoy eating ice cream between 70 and 75 degrees. However, W.Avy might want some more details about the weather. For example, he should ask about the rain or even the wind. If it's usually raining or windy, an ice cream shop will not be profitable. People won't go to the beach and spend on ice cream or surf equipment. W.Avy could also be interested in the weather frequency during the months of june and december. Luckily, we have done it for him (See the image below).
